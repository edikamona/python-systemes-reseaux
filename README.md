# Python Systems & Networks Projects

This repository contains Python scripts and experiments focused on:
- IT systems
- Networking fundamentals
- Automation and security-oriented use cases

The purpose of this space is to document practical work and continuous learning through real scripts rather than theoretical examples.

## Scope
Projects in this repository may include:
- System information and monitoring tools
- Network utilities (IP, ports, connectivity)
- Automation scripts
- Security-oriented experiments

## Philosophy
This repository is built as a practical workspace.
Learning is approached through experimentation, iteration, and problem-solving rather than academic exercises.

## Status
This project is actively evolving as new scripts and improvements are added progressively.

## Tools
- Python 3.x
- Visual Studio Code
- Git & GitHub
